# Notepad Website

## Overview

This project is a simple **Notepad Website** created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The site provides basic text editing features, allowing users to write, edit, and save notes directly in the browser. It was created to showcase front-end development skills as part of my Hacktoberfest contributions.

## Features

- **Text Editing**: Write and edit plain text in the notepad.
- **Save Notes**: Save your notes locally using the browserâ€™s `localStorage`, so your notes persist even after you close the browser.
- **Clear Notes**: Easily clear the current note to start fresh.
- **Responsive Design**: The design is responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices.
